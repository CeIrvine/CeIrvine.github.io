MedLink was originally inspired by my senior trip, during which I participated in GMAD's medical mission to Ghana, Africa. The mission lasted just over a week. In the early days, I worked to manage, document, and organize the flow of incoming and outgoing patients at the medical facilities. It was here that I recognized just how difficult it was to manage hundreds of desperate individuals, people who had waited years for help, many of whom were shamed, ostracized, or even near death.

Later in the week, I joined the surgical team, where I prepped patients for procedures, assisted surgeons in the operating room, and helped patients recover post-surgery. This experience made it clear how essential reliable, efficient systems are for managing patient care, especially humanitarian settings, where time and resources are limited. MedLink was born from this need.

As I came close to the end of my educational journey at Ogden-Weber Technical College I finally had acquired the tools and confidence to take this project on, little did I know this would only be the start of the journey.  

(the project isn't finished and so I will complete this page when it is finished).
